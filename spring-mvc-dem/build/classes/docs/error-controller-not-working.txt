Question:  HELP! My Spring MVC Controller is not working. What to do?

Answer:

Debug Tip #0: Make sure you are accessing the correct URL

You need to access the correct URL, localhost:8080/spring-mvc-demo/

Note: Do not attempt to run the JSP files directly. This will not work due to MVC.

Debug Tip #1: Make Sure your Package Names is consistent

The Spring configuration file used in the videos expects for your controller to be in the package:

package com.luv2code.springdemo.mvc;

Make sure your controller is this package.
