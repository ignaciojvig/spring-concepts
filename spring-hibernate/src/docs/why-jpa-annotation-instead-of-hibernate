FAQ: Why we are using JPA Annotation instead of Hibernate ?



QUESTION:
Why we are using JPA Annotation instead of Hibernate ?

For example, why we are not using this org.hibernate.annotations.Entity?

ANSWER:
JPA is a standard specification. Hibernate is an implementation of the JPA specification.

Hibernate implements all of the JPA annotations.

The Hibernate team recommends the use of JPA annotations as a best practice.
